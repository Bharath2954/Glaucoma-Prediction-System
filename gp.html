            <h2>What is Glaucoma?</h2><p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness if left untreated. It is often associated with increased intraocular pressure, but it can occur even when the pressure is within the normal range.</p>

            <h2>More about Glaucoma</h2>
            <p><b>The Sneak Thief of Sight:</b>
                <br>       Glaucoma is often called the "sneak thief of sight" because it can progress slowly without noticeable symptoms until significant vision loss has occurred. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection.
                <br><br>
               <b>No Cure, but Manageable:</b><br>        While there's no cure for glaucoma, it can be managed effectively with early diagnosis and proper treatment. Medications, surgeries, and lifestyle changes can help control the condition and preserve vision.
                <br><br>
                <b>Worldwide Impact:</b><br>        Glaucoma is a global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. It's a leading cause of irreversible blindness, especially among older adults.
                <br><br>
                <b>Various Types:</b><br>Glaucoma is not a single disease but a group of eye conditions with different causes and characteristics. These include open-angle, angle-closure, normal-tension, secondary, and congenital glaucoma.
                <br><br>
                <b>Genetic Links:</b><br>        Family history plays a significant role in glaucoma risk. If a close relative has the condition, your risk increases, and regular eye check-ups become even more important.
                <br><br>
                <b>Intraocular Pressure Isn't Always the Culprit:</b><br>        While high intraocular pressure is a common risk factor, some people develop glaucoma with normal eye pressure (normal-tension glaucoma), and others may have elevated eye pressure without developing the condition.
                <br><br>
                <b>Risk Factors:</b><br>        In addition to age and genetics, other risk factors include having thin corneas, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a history of eye injuries or surgeries.
                <br><br>
                <b>Diverse Treatment Options:</b><br>        Glaucoma treatment isn't one-size-fits-all. Ophthalmologists tailor treatments to the specific type and severity of the condition. Options include eye drops, laser therapy, microsurgery, and minimally invasive procedures.
                <br><br>
                <b>Preventable Vision Loss:</b><br>        With early detection and adherence to treatment, most people with glaucoma can maintain their vision and prevent significant vision loss.
                <br><br>
                <b>Awareness Matters:</b><br>        Glaucoma awareness is crucial for early detection and intervention. Regular eye exams, particularly for individuals at higher risk, can make a significant difference in preserving vision.
                <br><br>
                <b>Research and Innovation:</b><br>        Ongoing research into glaucoma is continually improving our understanding of the condition and leading to innovative treatments and technologies for its management.
                <br><br>
                <b>Global Efforts:</b><br>        World Glaucoma Week is an annual event that aims to raise awareness about glaucoma on a global scale, emphasizing the importance of regular eye exams and early diagnosis.</p>
